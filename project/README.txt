Hi! This app was created from my motivation to learn French during the quarantine.

So I've basically created a dictionary app that randomizes words and provides translations to different languages.

Currently, the app supports three types of languages: English, Chinese, and French. But more languages and be added if wished to.

There are multiple features that are currently working.

Feature 1: Translation
    This app provides translations to there langauges, FR, CN, EN. To default language is EN, and to translate them accordingly, just swipe to the left or right.
    The translation works in a wheel method, which means the language set will just circle back when swiped on the edge.
    Navigation can be found on the top and left corner of the screen.

Feature 2: Random word generator
    This app helps to randomize words. Just click on the "GET NEW WORD" button to randomize!

Feature 3: Word History
    This app also tracks the history of the user. Files are saved in a "sharedPreferences" file which means that it will saved upon exit.
    Users can also click on the words that are highlighted in blue to search for the words again!

Feature 4: Search for words
    There is also a built in SEARCH function. However, it only takes in exact words as no default words are saved as cache. (Part of the API's conditions)
    There will be a toast notification to show if the word entered in invalid.
    Upon searching a right word, the previous word will enter the "Word History" and the searched word will come up as the active one.
